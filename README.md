Raspbian ARM Assembly
=====================

Assembly ARM development environment
------------------------------------

This repo is supposed to provide a dockerized environment to compile, run and debug assembly ARMv7 compliant code. 

Is build upon a single ubuntu image containing all the tools and configuration needed in order to build your code.

I created it ion order to allow me and my university pairs to learn Assembly without the overhead of a virtual machine, and for self training purposes.

I have plans to integrate GdbGui debugging tool in this repo.
